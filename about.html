        timegen will be synchronised for viewers anywhere in the world who have their system time set correctly, even without an internet connection
        <br><br>
        however, there is some irony in that the viewers' system clocks are probably (though not necessarily) set via connection to the internet
        <br><br>
        serving suggestion: call a friend who is far away and view the same patterns together, even though you are physically distant
